// Use of 'npm install' :==>
// node modules are large files so no need to push it to github or send it to any one else
//but it is necessary to attach the 'package.jshon' file to install node modules other wise it cant be fetch what are the modules we use in our project
//now run : npm install  ==> it will bring the node module files to the project.
//attach the .gitignore file to the project and inside it put the node modules file so it will ignore the push command.
